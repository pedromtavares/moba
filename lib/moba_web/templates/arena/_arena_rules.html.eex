                <h5 class="text-center">Objective</h5>
                <p>Finish the match being #1 on the Ranking by acculumating Points. You will be awarded Shards if you manage to get in the Top 3, which you can use to unlock new Heroes and Skills.</p>
                <h5 class="text-center">Battles & Points</h5>
                <p>Unlike the Jungle, battles in the Arena cannot end in a tie, so you must kill your opponent in order to win Points. The amount of points won/lost depends on the difference of points between you and your opponent at the start of the battle. Note that you can also win/lose points when defending an attack.</p>
                <h5 class="text-center">Rounds</h5>
                <p>Each match is broken up into 2 rounds. In each round, you can attack every other opponent in the Arena once. You don't have to attack all of them, but all of them can (and probably will) attack you.</p>
                <h5 class="text-center">Skill Actions</h5>
                <p>There are 2 buttons located under your Skills in the bottom hero bar:<br/>
                    <span class="text-warning"><i class="fa fa-edit mr-1"></i> Edit Orders: </span>edits your skill and item orders that will be used when defending against other players.<br/>
                    <span class="text-danger"><i class="fa fa-refresh mr-1"></i> New/Switch Build: </span>you can add an alternate Skill Build to your hero when you enter the Arena and switch to it at any time.
