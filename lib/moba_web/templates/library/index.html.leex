If there aren't any targets you are confident in killing, aim for targets with low Offense to reduce your chances of dying. Aim for Normal and Hard targets only for optimal farming.</p>

                                  <p class="faq-answer mb-4">Ganking will always offer more rewards but it comes with more risk as you can die and have to buyback. Meditating/mining is a safe choice but can randomly offer very low rewards. Ideally you should only meditate/mine if you have no good targets to gank or if you have a specific build in mind that needs more XP or gold early on.</p>

                                  <p class="faq-answer mb-4">The Hero Ranking ranks heroes by their total farm, which is the amount of XP and gold you gain after finishing Training. Note that only by Ganking you can reach a higher total farm, as passive farming via Meditation and Mining offer less overall rewards than Ganking.</p>

                                  <p class="faq-answer mb-4">Unlike the Jungle which you can play on your own time, the Arena is played in daily matches divided between 2 rounds of 12 hours. In each round you can attack all other players once, you don't need to attack all of them, but they will probably all attack you. At the end of the second round, the match ends and rewards the top 3 ranked players with Shards and Medals, with a new match starting immediately.</p>

                                  <p class="faq-answer mb-4">You gain and lose Season Points with every battle in the Arena. The amount won/lost per battle depends on the difference of points between you and your opponent, similar to how the ELO system works. When the Arena match ends, the amount of Season Points you have gets added to your account permanently and is used to rank you against other players in the Season Ranking.</p>

                                  <h4 class="faq-question">What is a good strategy for the Arena?</h4>
                                  <p class="faq-answer mb-4">This mostly depends on what hero you picked, but overall it's a good idea to create an extra build that is more defensive and switch to it once you're AFK in the game. It's crucial to also have a defensive skill order (see previous question) set up to have the best chance possible, because, remember, you will be defending much more than you will be attacking. Also, for most builds, having 100 Speed is very important so that you always start attacking when you are the attacker, and on the higher levels of Arena play (top 10+) that can really be the defining factor of battles.</p>

Skins require that you have a hero in a certain league (Master/Grandmaster) before unlocking and you can switch between them when picking a hero for the Arena.</p>

                                  <p class="faq-answer mb-4">The Jungle Ranking rewards individual heroes more, however the Arena Ranking rewards the better player overall, as it is much harder to consistently win the Arena as you are fighting against other players.
