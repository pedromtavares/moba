defmodule Moba.Game.Schema.Skill do
  @moduledoc """
  Skills are the main vector of attacks in a Battle, used to apply active or passive effects
  while in a Battle. Heroes have 3 normal Skills and an ultimate, which is its strongest Skill.
  Active Skills usually cost MP to be activated and have a cooldown in order to be activated again.
  Passive Skills usually cost no MP and activate by themselves, usually providing bonuses every turn.

  This is a match-locked resource, meaning once a match starts, its stats cannot be changed,
  and any changes made on the admin panel will only be applied on the next match.

  Skills can be unlocked with shards, and may have a user level_requirement
