  Represents the base stats of a Hero, and comes with a pre-defined ultimate, which is a Skill.

  This is a match-locked resource, meaning once a match starts, its stats cannot be changed,
  and any changes made on the admin panel will only be applied on the next match.

  Avatars are also separated by role: tank, bruiser, carry, support and nuker

  Avatars can be unlocked with shards, and may have a user level_requirement
